<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In the last few years, with the advancement of technologies and digitization, the amount of data generated rapidly increased from Terabytes to Zettabytes and by 2025, it is predicted there would a big and tremendous volume of data collections and that would be nearly 163 zettabytes. To handle this huge volume of data and process them to draw meaningful insights technologies like Hadoop and its ecosystem come to rescue.

To explore on big data technologies â€“ Hadoop and its ecosystem, we opted to work on e-commerce data (Best Buy store website).Data collected includes information on products such as Cell phones, Desktops and Laptops. We aim to store and analyse this data to draw useful insights such as compare price of different cell phones along with the carrier. On the same lines, compare cost of laptops across different brands. Customer top rated products and so on.
